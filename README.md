Have a folder full of cloudformation templates without parameters that you want

## Other projects you might enjoy
[darthguinea with godeploy](https://github.com/darthguinea/godeploy) seems to be
largely trying to accomplish the same thing. Their competence level though does
seem to be higher than mine. This is actually my first ever project in Go so
it's a little rough around the edges. So one reason you might pick that project
over this one is that it's more likely to work correctly.

The reason you might choose mine is that it's MIT licensed.

## Citations
I originally came across [darthguinea's
godeploy](https://github.com/darthguinea/godeploy) project when I was trying to
find examples on GitHub for how to create CreateStackInput structs. I try not to
blatantly plagiarize, but I'm also entirely new at Go so if I see someone else
doing something I'm probably just going to assume that's how things are done in
go. [darthguinea](https://github.com/darthguinea), if you're reading this, and
you want me to change anything let me know. I'm fully ready and willing.
